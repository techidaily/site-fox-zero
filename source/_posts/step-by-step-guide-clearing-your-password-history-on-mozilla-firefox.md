## Method 1 – Delete Saved Passwords in Firefox using Menu

It is the simplest method to delete saved passwords. Click on the **Menu** button and then choose **Logins and Passwords**.

When you delete the single password, it won’t ask anything, but when you eliminate all the passwords, it confirms the action. So click on **Yes** to remove all passwords from your Firefox.

## Method 2 – Delete Saved Passwords in Firefox using Windows Explorer

In this method, you can remove the passwords directly from the Windows explorer. Though, it won’t let you delete single passwords. It will remove all the passwords at once. When you save your password in Firefox, it stores them on your hard drive somewhere. It is usually stored in the Profile folder with the name of logins.jason or signons.sqlite. If you delete this file, all your saved passwords will be gone.

To locate this file, you need to find the profile folder. To do that, click on the **Menu** button then **Help**.
